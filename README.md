# About additional/generated files
- `./AniYT/mpv-config/custom.conf`: like `mpv.conf`. Use if you want to separate it from the original MPV configuration.
- `./AniYT/data/playlists.json`: stores playlist information.\
Mainly to reduce repeated calls to YT-DLP API which slows down retrieval significantly when the channel has many playlists.
- `./AniYT/data/history.json`: store viewing history.
- `./AniYT/data/bookmark.json`: store bookmark.
- `./AniYT/data/channel_sources.txt`: list of channel sources.
- `./AniYT/mpv-scripts/gestures.lua`: Recommended if running in graphical session via termux-x11. [Details](https://github.com/CleveTok3125/AniYT-mpv-gestures)
- `./AniYT/mpv-scripts/sponsorblock_minimal.lua`: Use SponsorBlock to skip sponsorships. Similar to `gesture.lua`, it is only loaded automatically if in a graphical session via termux-x11.
- `./AniYT/data/playlists.diff`: File containing difference information after running `ani-tracker`
- `./AniYT/data/*.log`: Log files for debugging
- `./AniYT/data/*.lock`: This is a file created when the program runs. Delete it to terminate the program.

*If using python modules, these files are automatically generated in the working directory. `custom.conf` is not automatically generated, however it can be manually created in the working directory to use it.*

# Additional options
## SponsorBlock
- Use SponsorBlock plugin for MPV to skip OP/EN

## Ani-Tracker: Notify new videos in playlist
- This feature is separated from the original project and named `ani-tracker`
- Instructions are included in `ani-yt --full-help`
- The binary is included in the wheel of the original project, and can be run directly on the CLI. See [Usage](#usage)
- Can be run via the `tracker` subcommand of `ani-yt` as a wrapper.\
   For example `ani-yt tracker --help` will print help for `ani-tracker`

## Android
- For Android, use MPV with youtube-dl built-in. Refer to [this link](https://github.com/mpv-android/mpv-android/pull/58)\
   In addition, you can use MPV on [Termux-x11](https://github.com/termux/termux-x11). Refer [this setup instructions](https://github.com/termux/termux-x11?tab=readme-ov-file#Setup-instructions).
- In `--mpv-player termux-x11` mode, `gestures.lua` script will be loaded by default if present to provide mouse/touch gestures. See [setup instructions](https://github.com/CleveTok3125/AniYT-mpv-gestures?tab=readme-ov-file#setup-instructions) for usage. This mode will select monitor 1 by default and send the mpv run command through it instead of having to use the command line in the graphical session. **Requires `mpv-x`**\
   Need to run termux-x11 in the background in a separate termux session. If using `xfce4`, use (one of) [these commands](https://github.com/termux/termux-x11?tab=readme-ov-file#running-graphical-applications) to launch
   ```bash
   termux-x11 :1 -xstartup "dbus-launch --exit-with-session xfce4-session"
   ```
   or for convenience:
   ```bash
   bash ./AniYT/tools/tmux-x11-start ani-yt --mpv-player termux-x11 -h
   ```

# Non-project-related notification
_This notification is for the anime fan community, not related to this project._

Currently, channels that provide free high-quality copyrighted anime on YouTube such as MuseAsia are removing some old anime and moving them to other platforms (usually paid platforms). You can refer to alternative solutions such as [ani-cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli) or [AnimeVsub](https://github.com/anime-vsub) for Vietsub (no dub yet).
